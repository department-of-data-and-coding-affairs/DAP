# On Being Together

<div>
When working together or if things go wrong,<br/>
we acknowledge and work through differences.<br/>
In so doing, we transform and enlarge each other.<br/>
<br/>
To nurture our mutual growth,<br/>
<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;this is a place of<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;learning, understanding, and sharing;<br/>
<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;this is a place to<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;affirm tolerance and compassion;<br/>
<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;this is a place for<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;collaborative creativity.<br/>
<br/>
All the aspects of yourself you choose to bring to this place<br/>
are welcome here.<br/>
<br/>
Reciprocate! Welcome, embrace and learn from others<br/>
(even in the face of apparent hostility or misunderstanding).<br/>
<br/>
To act against this spirit invites ostracism,<br/>
a loss that diminishes us all.<br/>
<br/>
Thank you.<br/>
